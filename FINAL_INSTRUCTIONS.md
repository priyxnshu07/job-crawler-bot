## The Issue: Authentication Error

You're getting the authentication error because the environment variables need to be set BEFORE Flask starts.

## ✅ Solution: Use the Startup Script

I've created a script that sets everything correctly. Use this:

```bash
./START.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd "/Users/priyanshuparashar/Documents/daily work/jobcrawlerprototype"
source venv/bin/activate

# Set credentials
export EMAIL_USER="parasharpriyanshu08@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_PASSWORD="ocigzfqkmecxtcyy"

# Start app
python app.py
```

## 🌐 Access Your App

Once it starts, open: **http://127.0.0.1:5001**

## 🧪 Test Email

1. Login to your account
2. Click "Send Test Email"
3. Check your inbox: **parasharpriyanshu08@gmail.com**

## 📧 What the Error Means

"Authentication Required" means Flask-Mail couldn't authenticate with Gmail. This happens when:
- Environment variables aren't set
- The app password is wrong
- Credentials aren't available when the app starts

**Solution:** Set credentials BEFORE starting the app (use ./START.sh)

## 🎉 Once Working

After you get the test email:
1. Click "Enable Email Alerts"
2. Upload your resume
3. Get automated job notifications!

## 🚀 Your App is Ready

Everything is configured. Just start it with credentials and you're good to go!
