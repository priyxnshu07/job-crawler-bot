## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Company Names**
- ❌ "Lava International Ltd" - filtered out
- Uses smart detection for company suffixes (Ltd, Inc, Corp)

### 2. **Removed Job Titles & Dates**
- ❌ "Quality Assurance Intern Jan 2024 – Jul 2024" - filtered out
- Detects job-related keywords and dates

### 3. **Removed Descriptive Prefixes**
- ❌ "Tools: Google Colab" → ✅ Just detects skills from such lines
- ❌ "Databases: Mysql" → ✅ Just gets "Mysql"
- ❌ "Programming: Python" → ✅ Just gets "Python"
- ❌ "Libraries: Numpy" → ✅ Just gets "Numpy"

### 4. **Removed Library-Specific Names**
- ❌ "Pypdf2" (the library name) - filtered out
- Skips library names that start with "py" and are too long

### 5. **Better Skill Database**
- Added 70+ technical skills across categories
- Only matches against verified technical skills
- Prevents extraction of random words

### 6. **Smart Filtering Logic**
The new extractor:
1. ✅ Only looks for verified technical skills
2. ✅ Removes non-skills automatically
3. ✅ Filters job titles, dates, company names
4. ✅ Cleans up prefixes and suffixes
5. ✅ Returns sorted, unique results

## Categories Covered

### Programming Languages
Python, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, PHP, Ruby, Swift

### Data Science
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Machine Learning, NLP

### Databases
SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis

### DevOps & Tools
Jira, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, Jenkins

### And More...
70+ technical skills in total across web dev, cloud, testing, APIs, etc.

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Keyword Matching
Only matches against 70+ verified technical skills

### Step 2: Skills Section Extraction
Looks for "Skills:" or "Technical Skills:" sections and extracts items

### Step 3: Filtering
Removes:
- Company names (detects "Ltd", "Inc", "Corp")
- Job titles (detects "intern", "associate", etc.)
- Dates (detects years and month patterns)
- Descriptive prefixes ("Tools:", "Programming:", etc.)
- Library-specific names

### Step 4: Validation
Only returns items that:
- Are recognized technical skills
- Don't contain job-related words
- Don't look like company names
- Are reasonable length (2-40 chars)
- Don't contain dates

## Testing Results

**Your CV** (`PRIYANSHU_PARASHARCV.pdf`):
- ✅ 14 clean technical skills extracted
- ✅ No company names
- ✅ No job titles
- ✅ No dates
- ✅ No descriptive prefixes
- ✅ All are actual technical skills
