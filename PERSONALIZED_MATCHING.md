- **Green (High)**: 50%+ match - Strong match!
- **Yellow (Medium)**: 25-49% match - Some relevant skills

### 2. **Matched Skills Display**
Shows exactly which of your skills matched each job:
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Machine Learning
- etc.

### 3. **Two Search Modes**

#### Regular Search
- Type keywords like "Python" or "Remote"

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload your resume** (if you haven't already)
2. **Click "Show Personalized Matches"** button
3. **See jobs sorted by match quality**
4. **Apply to the best matches first!**

## 🎯 The Algorithm

### Match Score Calculation:
```python
match_score = (matched_skills / total_user_skills) × 100
```

**Example:**
- You have 14 skills
- Job matches 7 of them
- Score: 7/14 × 100 = **50% Match**

### Matching Logic:
1. Checks if each skill appears in **job title**
2. Also checks **company name**
3. Counts how many skills matched
4. Calculates percentage
5. Sorts jobs by highest match first
